// Mid-run context watchdog (issue #59).
//
// pi only evaluates auto-compaction at a *user-turn boundary* — its
// `_checkCompaction` runs inside `_handlePostAgentRun`, which fires only after
// `agent.prompt()` has fully returned (i.e. once the model stops requesting
// tools and goes idle). During one long autonomous run this boundary is never
// reached: little-coder's small models routinely chain dozens of tool-call
// turns before yielding, so context grows unchecked and can blow straight past
// the window — pi then only reacts to the *overflow error* after the fact.
// charly1r reproduced exactly this: context climbing 34k → 40k → … → 64k across
// many `slot release` turns with no compaction until the request overflowed.
//
// pi does expose the levers to fix this from an extension: `ctx.getContextUsage()`
// reports live token usage against the active model's window, and `ctx.compact()`
// triggers pi's own compaction without awaiting it. This extension watches usage
// at every turn boundary and, once it crosses a threshold, proactively kicks off
// compaction — so a long single run compacts *before* it overflows, at roughly
// the same point pi would have if the model had yielded.
//
// Tuning / opt-out:
//   LITTLE_CODER_COMPACT_AT_PERCENT   trigger threshold, percent of the context
//                                     window (default 80). <=0 or >=100 disables.
//   LITTLE_CODER_NO_COMPACT_WATCHDOG=1  hard off.
//
// This is complementary to pi's end-of-run compaction, not a replacement — the
// `compacting` guard below keeps us from re-firing while a compaction is already
// in flight, and pi's own threshold/overflow paths still run at run boundaries.
//
// ── Compaction-loop guard (issue #68) ──────────────────────────────────────
// charly1r + Qm-jmz hit an unrecoverable state: after a mid-run compaction the
// resumed model re-reads project files, context climbs back over the threshold,
// the watchdog fires compact() *again* — but now the only summarizable slice is
// the tiny post-compaction tail, so pi's prepareCompaction returns nothing and
// throws "Nothing to compact". Because pi's compact() aborts & disconnects the
// agent *before* that check, the failed second compaction leaves the session
// wedged (nothing the user types recovers it). The same failure mode was traced
// upstream in oh-my-pi#4786 / fixed in oh-my-pi#5448; the deep fix (elide-rescue
// then re-prepare) belongs in pi itself, which little-coder only wraps.
//
// The wrapper-side guard here breaks the LOOP so the session never reaches that
// wedged state: after each compaction we measure the first known post-compaction
// usage, and if it's still at/above the threshold (compaction freed too little)
// we PAUSE automatic compaction and tell the user, instead of firing a doomed
// second compact(). It re-arms automatically once usage drops back below the
// threshold (a manual /clear, /compact, or a genuinely smaller turn). A failed
// compaction (onError, e.g. a "Nothing to compact" that still slips through)
// pauses the same way rather than silently retrying. The deep fix — detect the
// incompressible tail and elide-rescue before giving up — belongs in the pi
// runtime little-coder wraps and has been flagged upstream.
//
// ── Not every compaction "failure" is a failure (issues #91, #108, #109) ────
// pi's `compact()` hands the extension a single promise with two outcomes, and
// the #68 guard above treated *any* rejection as "compaction is futile, pause".
// Two of the three rejection shapes are not that:
//
//   "Already compacted"   another compaction landed first (pi's own threshold
//                         path, a user `/compact`, or a second in-flight call of
//                         ours), so pi's prepareCompaction finds the branch's
//                         last entry is a compaction and refuses. The context IS
//                         compacted; the only thing that failed is our call. But
//                         we pause and never send the resume message, so the run
//                         halts mid-task and the user has to type "continue"
//                         (guppy42, #109; charly1r's "it stops", #91).
//   "Compaction cancelled" the run was aborted or the session is being torn down
//                         (headless `-p` disposes as soon as the agent settles,
//                         which is the sub-coder case). Nothing failed and there
//                         is nothing to warn about.
//
// So outcomes are classified now: "already" resumes the run exactly like a
// successful compaction, "cancelled" is silent, and only a real failure
// ("Nothing to compact (session too small)", a provider error) still pauses.
//
// The crash in #108 is the other half of the same code path. Both callbacks run
// *after* pi's compaction settles, by which point the session may have been
// replaced or disposed, and pi invalidates the whole extension runtime on
// `dispose()`, so the captured `ctx.ui` getter and `pi.sendUserMessage()` throw
// "This extension ctx is stale after session replacement or reload". pi invokes
// the callbacks from a floating `void (async () => …)()`, so that throw became
// an unhandled rejection and took the process down with `exit 1` (heinrichI hit
// it in a sub-coder, whose headless child disposes the moment it settles).
// Nothing the watchdog reports is worth a crash: the UI handle is captured while
// the ctx is known-good and every post-compaction use of it is best-effort.

// ── Headless cannot survive a mid-run compaction (issue #115) ──────────────
// Or1j1n found the half of #108 that stopping the crash did not fix. Under
// `-p` the same long task that succeeds in the TUI exits `Request aborted`
// with code 1 and empty stdout, because pi's `compact()` is the *manual* path
// and its first act is to abort the in-flight run:
//
//   async compact() { this._disconnectFromAgent(); await this.abort(); ... }
//
// print-mode then reads the run's verdict off the last message and skips
// printing the answer:
//
//   if (stopReason === "error" || stopReason === "aborted") {
//     console.error(errorMessage || `Request ${stopReason}`); exitCode = 1;
//   }
//
// There is no way to call compact() safely from inside a headless run. pi holds
// `_isAgentRunActive` true for the whole of `_runAgentPrompt` and only clears it
// in `_emitAgentSettled`, so `abort() -> waitForIdle()` cannot resolve while the
// run is still on the stack. Calling it from `turn_start` aborts the run;
// calling it from `agent_end` deadlocks instead (measured: a run hung past 400s
// before the approach was abandoned).
//
// pi's OWN threshold compaction has neither problem: it runs inside
// `_handlePostAgentRun`, where a compaction is expected, and it ends with
//
//   // Auto-compaction can complete while follow-up/steering/custom messages are waiting.
//   // Continue once so queued messages are delivered.
//   return this.agent.hasQueuedMessages();
//
// which the caller turns into `agent.continue()`. So headless does not need us
// to compact. It needs a *queued continuation* at the moment pi compacts, which
// is what the `session_compact` handler below provides. The mid-run path stays
// TUI-only, which is where it works and where #59 needed it.
//
// What headless gives up is our threshold: pi decides when to compact there,
// and a run that blows the window without ever reaching a boundary still falls
// to pi's own overflow recovery, which handles it once per user message. Both
// are real limits, and both are better than losing the run outright.
