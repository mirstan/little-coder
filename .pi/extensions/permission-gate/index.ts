// SHELL_TOOLS now, and they all go through the same whitelist.

 *
 * 1. **Judge every segment.** The check ran on the raw string, so only the
 *    first command was ever inspected — `ls && rm -rf /` was "safe" because it
 *    starts with `ls`. Each segment of a `&&`/`||`/`;`/`|` chain now has to
 *    match on its own.
 * 2. **A write is never safe.** `cat` is whitelisted, so
 *    `cat > backend/main.py << 'ENDOFFILE'` passed the prefix test outright.
 *    Any command carrying a redirect/tee/dd target is refused regardless of
 *    which binary it starts with; write-guard then decides whether that
 *    particular path may be written.
