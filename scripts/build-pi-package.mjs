//   evidence         — GAIA benchmark evidence collection, benchmark-specific
//   evidence-compact — GAIA benchmark evidence collection, benchmark-specific
//   hello            — example/test extension
//   project-context  : loads the project's AGENTS.md / CLAUDE.md. That exists
//                      only because little-coder launches pi with
//                      `--no-context-files` (issue #104); vanilla pi already

//                      inject a SECOND copy of the same instructions.
// Dependency-forced exclusions (depends on a PR-review-excluded extension):
//   browser-extract-retention — imports from excluded evidence; would break at load time
//
// NOTE: `llama-cpp-provider` and `phase-model` are intentionally SHIPPED.
// The reviewer explicitly wants `plan-mode` included (it's genuinely useful to
// vanilla pi users), but `plan-mode` statically imports `enterPhase` from
// `phase-model`, which statically imports `resolveOverridePath` from
// `llama-cpp-provider/config.ts`. Without those two the package would NOT be
// loadable. They are therefore kept and documented as runtime dependencies of
// plan-mode.

**A curated subset of little-coder's extension layer, NOT little-coder-in-a-box.**

This package ships extensions and skill-injection content extracted from
[little-coder](${webRepoUrl}) (v${version}). It is a pi package: install it into your pi
install and pi's launcher will auto-load the shipped extensions.

It does **not** include the little-coder launcher or any of the
launcher-level wiring that makes little-coder behave as it does. Several
behaviours you may be used to come from patching pi itself or from
launcher-level code in \`bin/\`, not from extensions — see **Behavioral
differences outside the little-coder launcher** below.

## Install

\`\`\`bash
npm install pi-little-coder
\`\`\`

pi will auto-discover and load the shipped extensions on next launch.

## What's Included

### Extensions (${shippedExtensions.length})

${extListMd}

### Skill categories (${PI_PACKAGE_SKILL_DIRS.length})

${skillListMd}

These \`skills/\` subdirectories are bundled for use by the
\`skill-inject\` and \`knowledge-inject\` extensions; they are not standalone
pi skills.

## Behavioral differences outside the little-coder launcher

A number of little-coder behaviours are **not** shipped in this package because
they live in launcher-level code, not in extensions:

- **pi source patching** — \`scripts/patch-pi.mjs\` re-applies small source edits
  to the installed \`@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent\` on every launch (e.g. suppressing
  pi's bare "Operation aborted" result marker). This is patching pi itself, not
  extending it. Outside the little-coder launcher those edits are absent, so you
  may see that marker surface in aborted runs.

- **Extension loading order** — little-coder launches pi with \`--no-extensions\` and
  then loads extensions in a specific order via explicit \`--extension\` flags. That
  ordering matters for some extensions. The package ships extensions but does not
  control load order; pi's own discovery order is used.

- **Global settings merge** — the launcher writes \`quietStartup\`, pins
  \`lastChangelogVersion\`, and applies other settings to pi's global config.
  Without that wiring, startup may be chattier.

- **llama.cpp context re-probe** — little-coder probes and reconfigures the
  llama.cpp provider's context window on each launch; that logic lives in \`bin/\`.

- **Update flow** — little-coder's update check and \`/update\` command are wired
  in \`bin/\` and in the \`update-notice\` extension. Without the launcher wiring
  that extension degrades gracefully, but may not function as intended.

You may therefore observe different behaviour than in little-coder — for example,
an aborted-run marker may appear, startup may produce more output, or extensions
that rely on specific load ordering may behave differently. This is expected.

## Upstream

Built from [little-coder](${webRepoUrl}) v${version}.
See [UPSTREAM.json](./UPSTREAM.json) for build provenance, shipped extensions, and
skill categories. This package tracks the main little-coder version; when
little-coder ships a new release, a corresponding package release is cut.
