"""Aider Polyglot runner for little-coder.

Drives `pi --mode rpc` per exercise via benchmarks/rpc_client.py::PiRpc.
Per-language transforms (xit-strip, @Disabled-strip, cpp CMakeLists
named dirs, cargo --include-ignored, EXERCISM_RUN_ALL_TESTS) are copied
verbatim from little-coder's original aider_polyglot.py — the only real
change is that the agent call site uses PiRpc instead of agent.run().

Usage:
    python benchmarks/aider_polyglot.py              # full run, default model
    python benchmarks/aider_polyglot.py --language python
    python benchmarks/aider_polyglot.py --exercise hello-world --language python
